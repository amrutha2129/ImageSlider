# ImageSlider

## Approach

* I have followed an iterative approach.
* I planned to create a simple image slideshow first.
* And then, thumbnails under the main image slideshow.
* And then, Play and pause functionality.
* And then, dynamic drag and drop of pictures in the slideshow.

## Steps to run the application

* Unzip the project zip file, ImageSlider.zip
* Click on ImageSlider.sln inside the project folder.
* Run the project.
* You can see the Image slider on the screen.
* Click on the round white buttons on the left and right for navigation.
* It is an unfinished application.
